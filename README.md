libhxl-js
=========

JavaScript support library for the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) data standard.

http://hxlstandard.org

# Overview

This library will be designed for use in client-size applications,
including fully-browser-based apps: it will allow loading a HXL
dataset directly into a browser client and manipulating it there.

The library may eventually include integration points with popular
client-side libraries like [jQuery]() and [D3]() (to be decided).
