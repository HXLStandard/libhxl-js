libhxl-js
=========

JavaScript support library for the Humanitarian Exchange Language (HXL) data standard.

http://hxlstandard.org

# Overview

This library will be designed for use in client-size applications,
including fully-browser-based apps: it will allow loading a HXL
dataset directly into a browser client and manipulating it there.

The library may eventually include integration points with popular
client-side libraries like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[D3](http://d3js.org/), and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (to be
decided).
